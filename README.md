## Technologies Used

## Note

> The "Task Done" functionality has not yet been added. I'm considering various implementations, such as crossing it out on the existing screen, deleting it, moving it to the bottom with different styles, or creating a new tab for 'Completed Tasks'.

## Features

1. **Add Task Items**  
   Items can be added via an input field at the bottom of the screen. You can either press 'Enter' or click the '+' button to add the task.

2. **Edit Task Items**  
   Items can be edited by clicking the 'Settings' icon next to each task and selecting 'Edit'. After making changes, press the 'Save' button to update the task.

3. **Delete Task Items**  
   Items can be deleted by clicking the 'Settings' icon next to each task and selecting 'Delete'.
